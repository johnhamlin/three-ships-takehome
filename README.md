# John Hamlin's Three Ships Take Home

I had fun writing this!

I look forward to discussing my code and design decisions with the dev team!

## Viewing the Finished Project

I deployed this app on Vercel, so you can see it in action at [https://three-ships-takehome.vercel.app/](https://three-ships-takehome.vercel.app/)

**Open it on your phone too! I adapted the design for mobile.**

## Technologies Used

- ⚛️ Next.js / React
- ✈️ Tailwind CSS
- 💫 Framer Motion
  - Animate reordering of cards when the user filters them
- 🎈 Floating UI
  - Mobile-friendly popover for more information on the ℹ️ icon

## Running Locally

To run this on your own machine, clone this repo, install the dependencies and start the dev server.

```SH
git clone https://github.com/johnhamlin/three-ships-takehome.git

cd three-ships-takehome

npm install

npm run dev
```

## Notes

- The flame icon for the popular badge is the closest one I could find. In a real setting, I'd ask the designer for the exact icon.
